OSINT Collection: Leverage the built-in OSINT tools for gathering information on IP addresses, domains, or even social media profiles. These tools can be customized based on your specific needs.

Use in Penetration Testing: IDS_OSINT_Tool can be used as part of a penetration testing toolkit to assess the security of a network and gather intelligence on potential vulnerabilities.

Customization: You can customize the behavior of both the IDS and OSINT tools by modifying configuration files or adding new features to suit your specific use case.

Visualize Data: The integrated graphical interface provides visualizations of detected threats, network traffic, and intelligence gathered from OSINT sources, making it easy to interpret and respond.
